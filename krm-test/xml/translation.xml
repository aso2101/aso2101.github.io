	  <l>Everyone who is committed to going step-by-step</l>
	  <l>along the completely correct <hi>Way</hi> of Lord Nr̥patuṅga.</l>
	  <l>will unfailingly be able to attain a rank that comes from</l>
	  <l>toiling on poetry of unsurpassable beauty by means of this system.</l>
	</lg>
	<lg n="147">
	  <l>Through the learnedness that comes from</l>
	  <l>serving the Young Woman who is Śruti</l>
	  <l>one who has understood without any gaps</l>
	  <l>the opinions and recommendations regarding ornaments </l>
	  <l>proclaimed by King Atiśayadhavaḷa,</l>
	  <l>will become the best among those who have fulfilled their duty.</l>
	  <note>
	    <p>This verse contains three words that are used elsewhere in the Way as titles of King Nr̥patuṅga: Atiśayadhavaḷa, Nītinirantara, and Kr̥takr̥tyamalla. If, however, we try to read them as titles in the present verse, we cannot produce a coherent meaning. The repetition of the titles, then, is only an “apparent repetition” (<hi>punaruktyābhāsa</hi>). We follow Seetharamaiah’s lead in reading two of these words in their literal senses, such that the verse as a whole functions as a phalaśruti, which speaks of the benefits of studying the Way. One such benefit is that the reader actually takes on the qualities that are embodied in Nr̥patuṅga’s titles.</p>

	  <l>Without letting even a single word surpass the idea</l>
	  <l>on account of the beauty of vernacular expression,</l>
	  <l>as if the words themselves intended to conform to the idea,</l>
	  <l>without faltering amid those terrifying syllables of Kannada </l>
	  <l>speech, with the maturity of Sanskrit expressions serving </l>
	  <l>as the standard, the system of Nītinirantara is put forth,</l>
	  <l>having achieved loftiness/gentleness, having grown</l>
	  <l>like creeping vines left to spread where they will.</l>
