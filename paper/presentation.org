  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  This paper comes out of my attempt to make sense of two apparently contradictory positions.
  1. The Sātavāhanas were devout followers of Brahmanism who performed Vedic rituals. (This statement seems true, but I have encountered some implications that are less obviously true, such as: Sātavāhana rule represented a “return to orthodoxy” after the Aśoka, or the Sātavāhanas deliberately overturned the legacy of Aśoka, for instance by publicly performing the kinds of sacrifices that Aśoka had previously banned.)
  2. The Sātavāhanas were great patrons of Buddhism. (Again, this statement seems true, but precisely what it means or implies is unclear.)
  Of course the contradiction is /only/ apparent: it’s easily possible for a ruler to support a variety of religions, whatever his personal persuasion might be. But the contradiction raised a set of questions that I would like to think through with you today.

* Major Questions
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: ./images/godavari.jpg
  :END:
  1. What might the relationships between the state and a religion /mean/ in the Deccan in the early centuries of the common era?
  2. What do we know?
  3. How do we characterize it?
  4. What kind of story can we tell?
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  1 is a *conceptual* question.
  2 is an *empirical* question.
  3 is an *analytic* question.
  4 is a *historical* question.
  /ad/ 3: That is: what are the distinctive features of the relationship between Buddhism and the State under the Sātavāhanas /vis-à-vis/ other political formations (e.g., in India, the Mauryas on one side, and the Ikṣvākus on the other side; outside of India, we can think of an unlimited list of other examples).
  /ad/ 4: That is: is there any evidence for a change in this relationship over the course of the Sātavāhana Empire? How might we connect it with long-term tendencies in the history of Buddhism? (In terms of its institutional forms, its relationship to state power, its transregional character, and so on?) — In this connection, we can think about the conclusions presented by *Matthew Milligan* yesterday afternoon, who reminded us that *Kings don’t donate to Buddhist communities* in the second and first centuries BCE.
  #+END_NOTES

* Religion and the State
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal_background: ./images/godavari.jpg
  :END:
  1. Does the state maintain circumstances that are (legally, financially, etc.) /favorable/ or /unfavorable/ to Buddhist communities? 
  2. Do these communities have a “political philosophy” that sets out a normative vision of the state’s role in society as a whole?
  3. Does the state have a normative vision of its own role /vis-à-vis/ different religious communities? 
  4. If so, how does this vision cohere or conflict with the religious commitments of individual rulers?
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  /ad/ 4: We can imagine situations where a ruler’s “personal” inclinations and “official” duties might prescribe different courses of action.

  To bring this down to the ground: we know that Deccan in the first and second century was populated by Buddhists, Jains, and Brahmins, and who knows what else. And these groups were also internally divided. What are kings to do in the face of this religious diversity?

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  On the one side: a ruler who belongs to a dynasty of /Brahmin/ kings, who has the very word for Vedic sacrifice in his name, who nevertheless presided over what could easily be called the “golden age” of Buddhism in the Deccan.

  On the other side: the monk who made Buddhism philosophical, arguably, by using the language and discursive forms of Brahmanism.

  I should say that I have not decided to put these figures together. I found them like that, so to speak. There are many texts that speak of Nāgārjuna and a Sātavāhana king as /friends/. I don’t have anything to add to the existing discussion about the historicity of those traditions, and I refer interested parties to the work of Ian Mabbett and Joseph Walser. I am not even sure that the Sātavāhana king who was Nāgārjuna’s friend was Gautamīputra Śrīyajña Sātakarṇi, although I consider that possibility most likely. What I am interested in, instead, is what these two figures /symbolize/ and how they can put the question of the relationship between state and religion into focus. I am following the lead of the great Sylvain Lévi, whose final article breaks off right in the middle of a discussion about the friendship between these two figures.

   The *Nāṇeghāṭ Inscription* of Nāgannikā
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   One of the earliest surviving records of the Sātavāhanas; a monument to their own power, constructed at the entrance to the Deccan plateau. What did these early rulers think it was important for people to know about them?
   - *They performed a ton of Vedic sacrifices,* including a /rājasūya/ and at least two /aśvamedhas/.
   - *They gave a lot of gifts on the occasion of those sacrifices.*
   - *They expressed themselves in the “poetry of polity”* (as Sheldon Pollock calls later inscriptional discourse).

   The *Nāsik Inscription* of Gautamī Balaśrī
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   This inscription, from at least a century later, includes a long eulogy of the deceased king Gautamīputra Śrī Sātakarṇi. (I should mention that this inscription is one of the very few that I know of to have inspired an entire feature film, namely, the Telugu film /Gautamīputra Sātakarṇi/ which came out last year.) Here, the *Vedic sacrifices* have disappeared. Gautamīputra Śrī Sātakarṇi is presented as conforming to a model of kingship that is organized by /dharma/, but in the sense of “social order” rather than in the sense of “Vedic ritual.” In fact there is little religious content in this model at all. Here are a few examples:

   I’m now going to pair some of these passages with similar passages in Nāgārjuna’s /Ratnāvalī/. The /Ratnāvalī/ has, to my knowledge, has largely been seen as a “reader’s digest” version of Buddhism, and of Mahāyāna in particular. But it also has a specifically /political/ character, and we should take its identification as a /rājaparikathā/, “political discourse,” seriously. I will only give a few examples. I probably don’t need to remind this audience that the addressee was identified by Ajitamitra as /bDe spyod/ (/We chö/), that is, Sātavāhana.

   I should also note that I’m basically going to exclude the /Suhr̥llekha/ from this analysis, mostly for reasons of time, although as you all know, this text was supposedly addressed by Nāgārjuna to his “friend,” a Sātavāhana king.

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Here Nāgārjuna recommends a specific /policy/ for the state’s intervention in religious affairs, which we can call /conservative pluralism/: if previous monarchs have granted specific provisions for particular religions, then current monarchs should leave them as they are. There is a game-theoretical aspect to this argument: don’t take away our privileges, and we won’t take away yours if we ever have the chance.

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Another important principle is /impartiality/. The truth is hard to know, so a king shouldn’t be partial to one or another interpretation of Buddhism. This makes sense for Nāgārjuna to say given the landscape of Buddhism in the Deccan at the time, where the followers of the /Mahāyāna/ must have been a minority.

   Of course this only applies to Buddhism!

   This inscription was published more than 20 years ago, but hasn’t been satisfactorily interpreted. What is clear, however, is that a mid-second century king, Vāsiṣṭhīputra Śivaśrī Puḷumāvi, is laying down particular privileges or protections for the ascetic monks who are residing near the /mahācaitya/ at Kanaganahalli.

   A lot of the fourth chapter is about building /dharmāspadas/, religious sites. This is the famous verse that links Nāgārjuna with anthropomorphic images of the Buddha sitting on lotuses, such as we find in the very last phases of sculpture at Amarāvatī and then at Nāgārjunakoṇḍa. But the relevant point here is the Nāgārjuna thinks it is the king’s responsibility to commit substantial financial resources to the construction, decoration, and maintenance of Buddhist religious sites.

   Oskar von Hinüber has discussed this image in several recent publications (ARIRIAB 2014 and 2016: 13–14). It is not Gautamīputra Śrīyajña Sātakarṇi, but probably Gautamīputra Śrī Sātakarṇi, who lived about a hundred years earlier.

   The fact that a historical king is depicted in the very act of religious patronage that Nāgārjuna recommends in his /Ratnāvalī/ is perhaps not very surprising. Royal patronage is built into the very foundations of Buddhism, as *Matthew Milligan* reminded us yesterday.

   What is surprising is that this depiction is rather at odds with what we are able to reconstruct of the Sātavāhanas’ religious patronage on the basis of other sources, namely, inscriptions. So I will briefly review this situation and see what sense we can make of it.

   By the way, this donation of the village of Sudarśana (earlier called Pisājīpada) in around 103 CE was “exchanged” for the village of Sāmalipada about 3 years later, in an inscription (N3) in cave 3.

   Where was Nāgārjuna’s /Saṅghārāma/?
   - No shred of evidence from coastal Andhra (Amarāvati, Nāgārjunakoṇḍa, etc.).
   - Chinese pilgrims (Faxian and Xuanzang) report that the Sātavāhana king constructed a five-story rock-cut /saṅghārāma/ for Nāgārjuna.

   - It is called *波羅越* (/pārāvata/?) and glossed as *鴿 gē* “dove” by Faxian.
   - There is an as-yet unidentified mountain within the Sātavāhana Empire called /cakora/ “patridge” in several inscriptions.
   - It is called *跋邏末羅耆釐* (/bhramaragiri/?) and glossed as *黑蜂 hēifēng* “black bee” by Xuanzang, and similarly by Daoxuan. He locates it in (Southern) Kosala.
   #+BEGIN_NOTES   
   Unless Xuanzang is very badly confused, the /saṅghārāma/ should not be in coastal Andhra, but rather further north and west, probably around Telangana.
   
   We are looking in the wrong place. It has become clear in recent years that the Karimnagar district was a major, major center of Sātavāhana power, but there has been very little archaeological work done here.

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Addressing the king, as Nāgārjuna does in the /Ratnāvalī/, and representing the king, as we see in the Kanaganahalli relief, meant tapping into a particular kind of political imagination, and speaking to a /public/ that was constituted by that imagination. 

   The king is therefore a /public/ figure, in the sense that he was the object of public address and representation for those, like Nāgārjuna, who wanted to project and promote a particular vision of society.

   Being a public figure entails /publicity/ and its associated technologies. This is something that the Sātavāhanas seem to have excelled at. They perfected the art of political self-representation, evident in the surviving inscriptions and monuments, as well as on their coins.

   On one final note, I want to speculate about why a Brahmin king named Śrīyajña might have not only put up with the constant unsolicited advice of a Buddhist monk, but, if the sources are to be believed, actually gave him huge amounts of money.
